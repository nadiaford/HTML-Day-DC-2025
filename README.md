# HTML Day Washington DC 2025

## Overview

This project is **NOT** the dedicated webpage for **HTML Day**, an exciting event in Washington, DC, set to take place in 2025. As this event has yet to be hosted in DC, I was thrilled to take on the challenge of creating a webpage that captures the spirit of HTML Day and showcases what attendees can expect.

## Motivation

Having a personal stake in the web development community, I wanted to contribute something meaningful for this special occasion. The decision to create a webpage stemmed from my excitement to celebrate HTML and the opportunity to bring together enthusiasts in the nation's capital.

## Features

- **Event Information**: Details about the event, including date, location, and activities are subjected to change.
- **Registration Links**: Easy access for attendees to sign up and participate. Link will be provided, closer to the event.
- **Humorous Touch**: A bit of light-dark humor with a nod to the fictional HYDRA at the top of the page—because what’s a DC event without a playful reference to some supervillain shenanigans?

## Light-Dark Humor

As a fan of both web development and superhero lore, I included a playful nod to HYDRA at the top of the page. I hope it brings a smile rather than a spook! After all, we all need a little humor, especially when gathering to celebrate our passion for HTML.
